<h6>So what does a dead ex Navy commander have to do with making you more sales?</h6>

<p>Well, you may have heard of a famous ad with the headline <em>“They Laughed When I Sat Down At the Piano But When I Started to Play!”</em></p>

<p>John Caples wrote this ad in 1926 for the U.S. School of Music which went on to become one of the <strong>most popular and successful ads in history</strong>.</p>

<p>As well as rising to the rank of Navy commander during World War II; John wrote several books, including “Tested Advertising Methods” which was first published in 1932 and is now in its 5th edition; and was elected to the American Advertising Federation’s Hall of Fame.</p>

<p><strong>John knew how to write words that sell.</strong></p>

<p>We follow John’s scientific process on writing, and like John, <em>we get results</em>.</p>

<p>Now, we know you’ve struggled to find copywriters who have that special touch when it comes to engaging a reader. (I should know, I’ve been hiring copywriters for over 5 years.)</p>

<p>We understand that struggle, and so we developed a writing process that was <strong>measurable and repeatable</strong>, and packaged our services up into plans with defined deliverables.</p>

<p>This way you always know what you’re getting and for how much.</p>

</ul>

<h2>How it works:</h2>

<ol>
