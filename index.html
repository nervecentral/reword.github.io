<h6>Myself and two other (British &amp; American) writers offer a professional blog and article writing service with some big differences …</h6>

<p>We went and researched what it took to generate a LOT of traffic with blogging.</p>

<p>We found there were a number of similarities between the most popular blogs on the Internet:</p>

<ul>
<li>Long posts between 2,000 - 3,000 words. The average content length for a web page that ranks in the top 10 results for any keyword on Google has over 2,000 words.</li>
<li>Posts with videos, images, and lists will attract over 40% more links than a plain text post.</li>
<li>Any claims made in the post were backed up with links to their original sources to prove authenticity.</li>
<li>The more posts per week, the more traffic generated.</li>
<li>Quality content is essential, make sure your posts are truly epic.</li>
</ul>

<p>It’s competitive out there. The standard 500 word post just doesn’t cut it any more. To truly stand out from your competitors, you’ve got to do that little bit extra and that’s why we created this service.</p>

<p>I’ve been creating content for the web for over 17 years now and it’s still my passion. As a Conversion Rate Optimization consultant, I know the power words have in moving readers emotions, and like everyone else I love a good story.</p>

<p>And that’s what we produce—stories that engage the reader, stories that educate the reader, stories that people want to share with their friends and colleagues.</p>

<p>Worried your business isn&rsquo;t &lsquo;interesting&rsquo; enough to write about? We can still help you.</p>

<p>We take facts and events within your industry and turn them into stories. </p>

<p>If you&rsquo;ve read &lsquo;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Goal_(novel)">The Goal</a>&rsquo; by Eliyahu M. Goldratt you&rsquo;ll know how powerful stories are in engaging a reader—even for those more &lsquo;mundane&rsquo; topics.</p>

<p><a href="/contact/" class="button button-primary">Work with us »</a></p>

<p>Now, it’s hard to find copywriters who have that special touch when it comes to engaging a reader. I know, I’ve been hiring copywriters for over 5 years.</p>

<p>So I’ve put together a small team of talented writers, personally selected by me, who know how to write copy that transports your readers away, if only for a moment, from their dreary day to day existence.</p>

<p>These guys and gals know how to create a story around your business … to build interest, to spark discussion, and to draw traffic to your website.</p>

<h2>This service is not for you if:</h2>

<ul>
<li>You&rsquo;re expecting results in the first month. It can take between 6-12 months before you see a return on your investment. To truly reap the benefits out of my service, you should be looking to invest for 6 months before evaluating renewal.</li>
<li>You&rsquo;re expecting every post to go viral. Sure we want every article we write to be an instant hit, but this isn’t going to happen. But even your less popular articles will consistently send you traffic year after year.</li>
<li>You think it’s all about keywords. Of course SEO plays a part in your blog’s success, but first and foremost we write for humans. </li>
</ul>

<h2>How it works:</h2>

<ol>
<li>You fill out a questionnaire with the information we need to create truly epic blog posts that resonate with your target audience.</li>
<li>We assign one or more dedicated writers to you. We invite you to a Trello board to view the blog schedule.</li>
<li>Your writer spends up to 6 hours researching and writing each blog post.</li>
<li>Each post is reviewed by an editor.</li>
<li>Unique images are sourced for each post.</li>
<li>The post is added to your CMS or blog, ready for review and publishing.</li>
</ol>
